This is a Python script that I have modified to add more features.


NOTE:- I DO NOT OWN THIS SCRIPT.ORIGINAL WORK WAS DONE BY DAVID BOMBAL AND HIS TEAM. HERE IS LINK TO HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@davidbombal

Functionality added to the script:-
1. Ability to select multiple or all of the hosts connected to the Network for arp poisoning.
2. Ability to continue discovering and arp poisoning new hosts in the background while the script runs.
3. Ability to choose whether you want to save the captured traffic to a .pcap file or not.
4. Ability to save only HTTP traffic to .pcap file.

The rest of the script functions just like the original.

A BIG THANKS TO DAVID BOMBAL AND HIS TEAM FOR PROVIDING THE SOURCE CODE.
